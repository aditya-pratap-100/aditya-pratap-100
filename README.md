# 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Aditya Pratap** — a backend-focused **Full-Stack (MERN) Developer** passionate about building **real-world, scalable systems**.

I’m a final-year B.Tech student actively preparing for software development roles, with a strong focus on **backend engineering, APIs, and data-driven systems**. I believe the best way to learn is by building projects that mirror real production workflows.

**Core strengths:**

* Backend & API development
* Real-world system modeling
* Clean code & structured architecture
* Strong foundation in **DSA & OOPs**

# 🏥 OPD Token Allocation System

A **backend-driven system** that models real hospital OPD workflows, focusing on **fairness, priority handling, and scalability**.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Traditional OPD token systems struggle with:

* Emergency cases disrupting normal queues
* Fixed slot limits causing long waits
* Manual overrides leading to inefficiency

This project simulates a **real hospital OPD environment** and solves these challenges programmatically.

## ✨ Key Features

* 🔢 **Priority-based token allocation** (emergency & senior cases)
* ⏱️ **Elastic slot capacity** with dynamic adjustment
* 🧾 **Waitlisting mechanism** when slots are full
* 🚨 **Emergency override handling**
* 🔁 Real-world event simulation (no-show, late arrivals)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Architecture:** REST APIs
* **Tools:** Postman, Git, GitHub

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

* Real-world backend thinking
* Queue & priority-based logic
* API design & request handling
* Practical system modeling (beyond CRUD)

# 🍽️ Online Mess Subscription & Attendance Management System (Ongoing)

A **subscription-based food management system** designed for hostels and mess facilities.

> 🚧 **Status:** Actively under development

## 🎯 Project Goal

To replace manual registers and payment confusion with a **digital, subscription-driven system** that accurately tracks:

* Who is eligible to eat
* Which meal plan they are on
* Daily attendance and usage

## 🧩 Planned Features

* 📦 **Meal subscription plans** (weekly / monthly)
* 👨‍🎓 **Student dashboard** for plan selection & status
* 🧑‍💼 **Admin dashboard** for mess management
* ✅ **Daily attendance tracking**
* 🔐 Secure authentication using JWT

## 🛠️ Planned Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Auth:** JWT

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

This project focuses on:

* Real-world SaaS-style subscriptions
* Role-based access (admin vs student)
* Backend-driven business logic
* Clean data modeling

> This project is being built incrementally with a strong focus on **backend correctness and scalability**.
